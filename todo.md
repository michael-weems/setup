### Completed

- [x] operational waybar
    - [x] workspaces toggle on alt+number
    - [x] configure waybar theming, margins, fonts, etc...
- [x] config ghostty colors / blur / transparency
    - chose catppuccin-mocha
- [x] config rofi to look nice
- [x] look through the rest of hyprland setup: awesome-hyprland + the setup instructions recommendations 
    - https://wiki.hyprland.org/Hypr-Ecosystem/
    - https://wiki.hyprland.org/Getting-Started/Master-Tutorial/
- [x] setup ~~neofetch~~ fastfetch
- [x] configure tmux look and feel
    - [x] configure tmux to start window at 1 instead of 0
    - [x] setup .ready-tmux in ./projects/setup differently than ~/ such that it actually inits the project the way I like
- [x] fix border flicker on desktop 3
- [x] tailor waybar to my fonts / color theme
    - [x] configure background color opacity + background color of icons to fit with theme more
    - [x] put arch logo in top left instead of naruto logo
    - [x] move the cpu and ram usage to the top right instead of the middle
    - [x] fix the time + re-arrange the icon location
    - [x] re-arrange the icon location for volume
    - [x] add specific icons for each workspace icon
- [x] continue tailoring waybar - spacing / margins aren't quite right
- [x] hyprland: on boot, load a wallpaper
- [x] fix sound
- [x] obtain all catppuccin + rose-pine wallpapers again
- [x] move themeing to .local/themes + .local/scripts/theme
    - each module pulls in a theme file that gets overwritten by the .local/scripts/theme
    - a reload will apply the theme
    - this rather than each module defining every theme
- [x] change waybar to use the catppuccin layout
    - ~~[ ] tweaked so time is on far right~~
- [x] cleanup $PATH - its full of duplicates and is super long
- ~~[ ] waybar: stop logging to every console~~
- [x] wallpaper use fuzzy-find preview
- [x] waybar: change network ethernet look
- ~[ ] global gtk theme~
    - upon further investigation, it appears that theming gtk applications globally is a pain and is prone to errors and inconsistency due to different distros implementing it differently? something like that
    - also, I barely use GUI apps, so I'll just manually style each one instead of having the global fallback
- [x] use catppuccin's tmux config omg
    - [x] https://github.com/catppuccin/tmux
    - [x] and rose-pine's https://github.com/rose-pine/tmux
    - can literally just swap between these, don't need to make them look the same but with different colors
    - [x] senjou theme based off the rose-pine layout
- [x] tailor rofi to my color theme
    - [x] setup rose-pine theme
    - [x] setup senjou theme
    - [x] setup catppuccin theme
- [x] setup waybar to be able to hot-swap between themes
    - [x] catppuccin https://github.com/catppuccin/waybar
    - [x] rose-pine
    - [x] custom senjou theme
- [x] setup tmux to be able to hot-swap between themes
    - [x] catppuccin 
    - [x] rose-pine
    - [x] custom senjou theme
